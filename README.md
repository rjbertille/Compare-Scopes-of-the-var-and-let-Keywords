ES6_freeCodeCamp
<p>Fix the code so that i declared in the if statement is a separate variable than i declared in the first line of the function. Be certain not to use the var keyword anywhere in your code.</Â¨
<p>This exercise is designed to illustrate the difference between how var and let keywords assign scope to the declared variable.</p>
<p> When programming a function similar to the one used in this exercise, it is often better to use different variable names to avoid confusion.</p>
